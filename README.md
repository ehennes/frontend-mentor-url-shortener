## My process

### Built with

- Vue.js
- Vite
- Tiny Url API
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was my first time building with Vue.js and Vite. I know that I have barely scratched the surface of it, but I learned a lot during the process of building and I am excited to continue using both tools in the future. Tinyurl was a replacement for an api that was no longer available, but using it was very straightforward and easy to access. 

### Continued development

- Add error messaging for form 
- Add Vue routing if necessary 
- Fix glitching bugs occurring at certain screensizes
